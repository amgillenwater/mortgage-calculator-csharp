I recreated a project that I had originally completed in Python to learn about C# data types and variables. This is a simple Command line program that will calculate how long you need to save for a down payment based on the home's price, your salary, and how much of your salary you'd like to save each month.


## Assumptions for formula
1. Down payment is 25% of the home's cost.
2. Current savings is $0
3. Assume that you invest your current savings wisely, assume that your investments earn an annual return of r = 0.04 (4%).
4. Assume you are going to dedicate a certain amount of your salary each month to saving for the down payment. This variable should be in decimal form (i.e. 0.1 for 10%).
5. At the end of each month, your savings will be increased by the return on your investment, plus a percentage of your monthly salary.
